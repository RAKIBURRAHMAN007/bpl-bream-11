A brief description :- This website is about cricket and is named BPL Dream Eleven. On this site, I load data for more than 10 players, and I can choose available players. If a player is added once, I can’t add them again without sufficient credit. Players can be added to the "Selected" section in exchange for credit. I have a "Get Credit" button, which adds credit when clicked, allowing me to choose players if my credit limit meets the player’s price. If the credit limit is less than the player’s price, I cannot choose that player. I can select up to a maximum of 6 players. The "Available" button shows all available players, while the "Selected" button shows only the selected players. I can also delete players from the "Selected" section, which will add the corresponding credit back to the main credit balance.
